# Fruit-Veggie-Classification

Description:
Utilizing different CNN architectures and comparing their performances across 3 datasets. The datasets involved are duplicates of each other, but separated into different folders so they can be labeled differently. 
The number of classes across the datasets are as follows: Fruits_Vegetables_Datasets - 20 classes, Fruits_and_Veggies - 10 classes, Freshness - 2 classes.
The datasets were created and read into the code by reading from the folders they're contained in and labeled according to the folder name as opposed to the file name.

After the datasets were created and properly labeled, they 5 different CNN architectures were created. These are: Single Convolution Layer, LeNet-5, VGG-16, Alexnet, and InceptionResNetV2.
Various other architectures were tested, like ResNet50 and GoogLeNet, but these were either significantly outperformed or were too computationally expensive to run on the resources available to us.
